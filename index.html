    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p class="first">&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is an examination conducted jointly by the
        Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore and the seven Indian Institutes of Technology (at Bombay, Delhi,
        Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras and Roorkee) on behalf of the National Coordination Board (NCB)-GATE,
        Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India.</p>

    <p class="first">&nbsp;Qualifying in GATE is a mandatory requirement for seeking admission and/or financial
        assistance to: <br>(i) Master’s programs and direct Doctoral programs in Engineering/Technology/Architecture and
        <br>(ii) Doctoral programs in relevant branches of Science, in the institutions supported by the MHRD and other
        Government agencies. <br> Even in some colleges and institutions, which admit students without MHRD
        scholarship/assistantship, the GATE qualification is mandatory. Further, many Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)
        have been using the GATE score in their recruitment process.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>About GATE 2020</h3>
    <p class="second">&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is basically an examination on the
        comprehensive understanding of the candidates in various undergraduate subjects in Engineering/Technology/
        Architecture and post-graduate level subjects in Science. GATE 2020 will be conducted for 25 subjects (also
        referred to as “papers”) and it would be distributed over 1st, 2nd, 8th & 9th of February 2020. The GATE
        examination centres are spread in different cities across India, as well as, in six cities outside India. The
        examination would be purely a Computer Based Test (CBT).
        The GATE score would reflect the relative performance level of the candidate in a particular subject, which is
        quantified based on the several years of examination data.<br>
        <strong>NOTE : </strong>&nbsp; The GATE 2020 score is valid for <span>THREE YEAR </span> from the date of
        announcement of the results.</p>
